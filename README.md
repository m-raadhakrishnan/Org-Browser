# 🧠 Org-Browser

A custom-built organizational browser designed for companies to securely manage and monitor how employees access the web — whether they're working in-office or remotely. Empower your organization with its own browser solution, connected to a central user and activity management system.

## 🚀 Project Goal

> What if each organization had its own internally managed browser — customized to its needs, workflows, and access policies?
> **RetroGlassBrowser** answers that question by giving companies a lightweight desktop browser built with Python and Qt, featuring:

- 🔐 Central login/signup using Google Sheets
- 🌐 Logged browsing activity to a centralized tracker (with IP, timestamp, visited URL)
- 🗂️ Tabbed browsing for efficiency
- 📁 Bookmark support for quick access to work-related pages
- 🖥 Remotely usable across multiple employee devices
- 🎯 Controlled, private environment — not reliant on consumer-grade browsers
